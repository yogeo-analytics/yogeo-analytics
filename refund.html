    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    
    <p>At Yogeo Analytics, we are committed to providing a valuable and transparent learning experience. We understand that sometimes plans change, and we have designed a fair refund and cancellation policy to support our customers.</p>

    <h2>1. <strong>Course Cancellation by Customer</strong></h2>
    <p>If you wish to cancel your enrollment, you may request a cancellation by contacting our support team at <a href="mailto:yogeoanalytics@gmail.com">yogeoanalytics@gmail.com</a> within <strong>3 days of enrollment</strong>.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>A full refund will be issued if cancellation is requested before the course access is granted.</li>
      <li>If course access has been granted but less than 10% of the content has been accessed, a 75% refund is applicable.</li>
      <li>No refunds will be issued after 7 days or if more than 10% of the content has been consumed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. <strong>Course Cancellation by Yogeo Analytics</strong></h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to cancel any course due to insufficient enrollments or unforeseen circumstances. In such cases, 100% of the fee will be refunded or an alternative course will be offered at no extra cost.</p>

    <h2>3. <strong>Refund Process</strong></h2>
    <p>Approved refunds will be processed within <strong>7â€“10 business days</strong> from the date of approval. The amount will be credited to the original payment method.</p>
