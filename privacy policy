  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>At Yogeo Analytics, your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we collect, how we use and protect that information, and your rights with respect to your personal data.</p>

  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>We provide access to or share your information with operations and maintenance contractors and other third parties who perform services on our behalf. They are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services, which include billing, marketing, advertising, analytics, customer service, payment processing, and legal services.</p>

  <h2>Employers</h2>
  <p>If you participate in an Online Course sponsored or paid for by your employer, we may share information such as your progress, project status, interaction with mentors, assessments, and public profile with your employer.</p>

  <h2>Educational Institutions and Scholarship Partners</h2>
  <p>If you are enrolled in a course sponsored by an educational institution or scholarship partner, we may share your performance and progress with those partners, subject to their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Business Partners</h2>
  <p>With your consent, Yogeo Analytics may share contactable information with third-party business partners offering relevant products, services, or opportunities.</p>

  <h2>Protection of Yogeo Analytics and Others</h2>
  <p>We may access, retain, and disclose your information if required by law or if we believe such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, enforce our Terms, respond to claims, or protect the rights and safety of Yogeo Analytics and others.</p>

  <p>If your Profile is public, your information may be accessible by our hiring partners and include course performance, demographics, experience, and career goals.</p>

  <h2>Related Entities and Affiliates</h2>
  <p>We may share information with affiliates under common ownership with Yogeo Analytics.</p>

  <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
  <p>In the event of a business transaction such as a merger or sale, your information may be transferred as part of the assets. We will comply with applicable legal requirements regarding such transfers.</p>

  <h2>Aggregate/Anonymous Information</h2>
  <p>We may share aggregated or anonymized data publicly for purposes such as usage statistics, success rates, or survey results. This data does not personally identify you.</p>

  <h2>Your Legal Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or transfer your data. You may also revoke consent or object to direct marketing. To exercise these rights, contact us with your account details and a statement verifying your request is valid.</p>

  <p>We retain data only as long as necessary for business purposes or to comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>Third Party Links and Features</h2>
